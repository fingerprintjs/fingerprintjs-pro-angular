Introduce Fingerprint Agent API v4.

New package name is `@fingerprint/angular`.

This version removes the dependency on `@fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-spa` and uses `@fingerprint/agent` directly.
Caching is no longer enabled by default. To enable caching, you must configure it in the `startOptions` of the module.

The `clearCache` method has been removed from the `FingerprintService`. If you need to clear the cache manually, you should do it by directly interacting with the storage you configured.

> ⚠️This is a **breaking change**. Caching is no longer enabled by default.

### Why enable caching?

Caching is essential for:
- **Reducing API usage**: By storing visitor data locally, you avoid redundant calls to the Fingerprint API for the same visitor session.
- **Improving performance**: Cached data is returned instantly, resulting in a faster user experience.
- **Lowering costs**: If caching is not enabled manually after the upgrade, it will result in increased API usage on your Fingerprint Dashboard, which may increase your costs.

### Examples

#### Enabling session storage caching

```typescript
FingerprintModule.forRoot({
  startOptions: {
    apiKey: 'your-fp-public-api-key',
    cache: {
      storage: 'sessionStorage',
      duration: 'optimize-cost',
    },
  },
})
```

#### Enabling local storage caching

```typescript
FingerprintModule.forRoot({
  startOptions: {
    apiKey: 'your-fp-public-api-key',
    cache: {
      storage: 'localStorage',
    },
  },
})
```
